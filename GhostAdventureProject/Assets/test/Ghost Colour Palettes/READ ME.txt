How to use .gpl files in Aseprite:
----------------------
You can use the .gpl files in Aseprite by putting them into the palettes folder found at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Aseprite\data\palettes". To do so you may need to edit the properties of the palettes folder by unchecking "Read Only" to allow the .gpl files to be pasted inside.

Where are the RGB values?
-------------------------
The RGB values for each of the colour palettes can be found by opening their respective .gpl file in Notepad or from their .png files in the provided folder.
